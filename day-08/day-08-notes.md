# Day 08 Notes

## Antennas

* Have a location and frequency

## Antinode

* "an antinode occurs at any point that is perfectly in line with two antennas of the same frequency - but only when one of the antennas is twice as far away as the other"

How do I calculate the antinodes? There are two per pair of antennas of the same frequency.
